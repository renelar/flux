| You can exit swirl and return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the
| Esc key. If you are already at the prompt, type bye() to exit and save your
| progress. When you exit properly, you'll see a short message letting you know
| you've done so.

| When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore
|    what you do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options again.

| If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic related to
| R, you can type help.start() at the prompt, which will open a menu of
| resources (either within RStudio or your default web browser, depending on
| your setup).  Alternatively, a simple web search often yields the answer
| you're looking for.
